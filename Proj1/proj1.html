                    <p>In an effort to combat income inequality, our team created a sentiment 
                        analysis model using FinBERT, a lexicon-based machine learning model, 
                        to democratize financial knowledge for the average investor to maximize 
                        their probability of financial success. By applying sentiment analysis, 
                        we will be able to calculate the current market sentiment based on 
                        financial news that the average investor ingests. To do so, we will 
                        implement the FinBERT model, a pre-trained NLP model using a vast 
                        financial corpus, thereby fine-tuning it for financial sentiment 
                        classification.</p>

                    <p>This project is aimed to model the spread of COVID-19 in California State. 
                        In particular, we apply linear regression models to predict COVID-19 deaths 
                        for counties in California. Modeling and analysis have been carried out based 
                        on datasets detailing confirmed cases of COVID-19. Creating data-driven models 
                        enables us to prove if lockdown policies should be extended. It also has potential 
                        to provide estimates on how human activities will be directly affected by this 
                        disease in the future.

                    <p>Since its inception, Social Media has been serving as a medium for spreading conspiracy 
                        theories, misinformation, and confusion and in recent times, Anti-vaccination movements 
                        have been gaining momentum since the approval of COVID vaccines. 
                        The individuals/communities who refuse to wear masks, typically do not believe in the 
                        effectiveness of masks and perceive it as a threat to their rights and some even believe 
                        that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax. The influencers in such communities often aggravate 
                        the situation by strengthening negative hashtag trends and can potentially become a hazard 
                        to public health. Thus, as a responsible social media platform (i.e. Twitter) we analyze 
                        and try to understand the network of anti-vaccination and anti-mask hashtags to determine 
                        an effective strategy to tackle these movements.</p>
