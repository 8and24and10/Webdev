    <h2>Jackie Chan's biography</h2>
    <h3>Personal life</h3>
    <p>
        In 1982, Chan married Joan Lin, a Taiwanese actress. Their son, singer and actor Jaycee Chan, was born that same year. Chan's extra-marital affair with Elaine Ng Yi-Lei produced a daughter by the name of Etta Ng Chok Lam, born on 18 January 1999. It turned into a scandal within the media. Although he reportedly gave Elaine 70,000 HK dollars each month for her living expenses and 600,000 HK dollars when she moved to Shanghai, the transactions were later claimed to be nonexistent by her lawyer. Despite regretting the results of the affair, Chan said he had "only committed a fault that many men in the world commit". During the incident, Elaine stated she would take care of her daughter without Chan.

    <h3>Stunts and screen persona</h3>
    <p>
        Chan has performed most of his own stunts throughout his film career, which are choreographed by the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. The team was established in 1983, and Chan has used them in all his subsequent films to make choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member's abilities.Chan and his team undertake many of the stunts performed by other characters in his films, shooting the scenes so that their faces are obscured.

    <h3>Political Views</h3>
    <p>
        Since 2013, Chan has been a pro-Communist politician, serving in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. After the Hong Kong electoral reform in 2021, Chan became an Election Committee member and could vote for the Chief Executive.

    <h3>Legacy</h3>
    <p>
        Chan has received global recognition for his film acting and stunt work. His accolades include the Innovator Award from the American Choreography Awards and a lifetime achievement award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars.In addition, Chan has also been honoured by placing his hand and footprints at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Despite considerable box office success in Asia, Chan's Hollywood films have been criticised with regard to their action choreography. Reviewers of Rush Hour 2, The Tuxedo, and Shanghai Knights noted the toning down of Chan's fighting scenes, citing less intensity compared to his earlier films. The comedic value of his films is questioned; some critics stating that they can be childish at times. Chan was awarded the MBE in 1989 and the Silver Bauhinia Star (SBS) in 1999.
